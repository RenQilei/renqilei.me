# hugo-theme-babi

**Developing in progress without schedule.**

## Why babi?

Naming a repository is literally hard at least for me. When I was scratching my head, fortunately my roommate called me *Babi* /'bɑːbɪ/ for help. This actually means *daddy* or *Barbie* in Chinese. Whatever, I just grabbed it anyway. 🤪

## Acknowledgement

This is serious that I do appreciate to: 

* [olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even), which I previously used and now create based on.
* [Regis Philibert](https://regisphilibert.com/), an awesome guy who has a lot of useful blogs for Hugo and I felt his website is somehow where my design source from. And yes, he is also an emoji addict!

I will keep appending this list under my emotional control since there are too many open sources hardly to be covered. Thanks to all.

Seriously I am not expert on license issues, I just found out that you should keep codes open-sourced with the same license, that is what I mean, just do it for fun.
