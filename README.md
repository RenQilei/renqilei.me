[renqilei.me](https://renqilei.me) is my personal website containing blogs, projects and resume.

It is built up by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/RenQilei/renqilei.me) here.

## Deployment

Locally, ```hugo server``` will host it at ```http://localhost:1313/```.

## Theme

I customized a theme called [*babi*](https://github.com/RenQilei/hugo-theme-babi), go checking out and help upgrade it.
